Simple iOS tweak to make the Watch app think the watch wasn't bought in Russia, therefore un-hiding the pride watchfaces. 
Unfortunately, it's only visual, as the watch seems to check on its own. Perhaps someone might find this useful for testing, and maybe one day there's a true way to un-homophobe an Apple Watch that's been unfortunate enough to end up being a model for Russia.

To install, download the latest release and install it via your favorite way (open in package manager or type dpkg -i <package> in the console).
Please ldrestart or reboot and re-jailbreak after you've installed it.
